# PhD Applications FAQ

Every fall I get a flurry of emails asking about PhD applications. Sometimes people are interested in the general application process, and sometimes they have specific questions about Cornell. But since these questions tend to be similar, I'm writing out my answers here to save myself time in the future!

### Why am I qualified to answer these questions, and what are my biases? 

I'm currently a PhD candidate in Information Science at Cornell University, where I work with David Mimno in natural language processing, cultural analytics, data science, and computational social science. My answers will be tailored to these subject areas, so don't rely on them for other areas. At Cornell IS, the PhD students are heavily involved in the applications process, and I've reviewed applications for the past four years (reviewed materials, conducted interviews, observed faculty feedback). I worked in industry and got a master's degree before starting my PhD, and I applied to PhD programs in NLP in 2015. Applications were competitive then, but they've become much more competitive since, especially in NLP.

## General Questions

### Should I do a PhD?

This is such a hard question, and no one can answer it for you. I think that if you really want to do a PhD, you'll know and nothing will stop you. But here are some pros and cons that I would consider.

#### Pros
- Academic freedom to work on things that aren't immediately useful for industry.
- Stretching and growing your mind, thinking about new problems, finding inspiration.
- Being surrounded by other very intelligent and ambitious people. You'll have so many conversations and gain so many ideas from the people you meet.
- Setting your own schedule rather than sitting in an office from 9-5. 
- If you want to be a professor or a researcher at a big industry lab, this is the main pathway.
- Prestige. This might not be a *good* reason, but a lot of people are motivated by prestige and accolades. It's pretty cool to be able to say that you have a doctorate!

#### Cons
- Money! Even with summer internships, you're going to make so much less money than you would in industry (I'm writing here from a tech standpoint). Instead of doing the PhD, you could be saving for a house, fancy vacations, stability for your family, retirement. I would *seriously* consider this if money is at all a concern for you.
- Being surrounded by other very intelligent and ambitious people. It can get exhausting and frustrating after a while.
- Potentially moving to a place far from friends and family. 5-6 years is a long time to be mostly absent.
- Your mental health with very, very likely take a hit. I wasn't prepared for this at all and didn't think it could happen to me, but trust the numbers (an absurd percentage of PhD students report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation). It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't experienced it, but in academia, you are constantly being judged In addition, the power structures are ripe for abuse.
- You might not get an academic job. This is less of a concern in info sci, computer science, and related disciplines, but it's still a very real risk, especially if you have any constraints on location.
- 

### Where should I apply?

Focus on advisors, not universities. Your advisor will determine the majority of your experience, so I would recommend looking around for specific faculty whose work you find interesting. Ask friend or colleagues if they have recommendations for potential advisors, start following people on Twitter, and pay attention to the authors of papers that you like. Don't worry about university rankings (these often don't make sense after undergrad). If possible, apply widely (I think I applied to about 7-10 programs) and keep your mind open at this stage. There will be plenty of time to select between your options later, and until you start talking to people at different programs, it can be hard to tell from the outside which are the most exciting opportunities. 

### Which parts of the application are most important?

This depends on the person evaluationg your application, but I would say that your statement of purpose, letters of reference, and research experience (or publications) are the most important parts. I would put the most effort into these, and not worry as much about GPA, GRE, CV, and other details. Some people will indeed care about GPA, GRE, or the prestige of your credentials, but in my experience, most people are aware that different opportunities have shaped the applications of different people.

## Cornell Questions

### What's the difference between Information Science and Computer Science?

Not much! You take different core courses (IS courses focus on HCI, society, data science, design, networks) and you'll regularly attend different talks and be surrounded by different people. But we all sit in the same building, many of the faculty (like my advisor) advise students in both departments, and we have many shared events and academic interests. 

### What do you like best about Cornell Information Science?

Other than my advisor and the larger NLP research group, my main motivation in coming to Cornell was how friendly I found the students in IS. I felt much more comfortable here than at some of the other programs I applied to, which had less diverse student bodies. Cornell IS also tends to have a mix of younger and older students, and since I was coming from industry, I felt like the other students here understood me better. Aside from the students, I also love the wide range of academic interests in Cornell IS (human robot interaction, human computer interaction, design, science and technology studies, law, data science, art), and I've been inspired by the faculty to push myself in directions I never would have expected and wouldn't have experienced in a more traditional CS program. We're even required to do a "minor" in another department and have one person on our committee from another department, which I love.

### What's it like working with David Mimno?

David is 100% wonderful, and I'm incredibly lucky to work with him. Not all advisors are kind; David is very kind. I have nothing but good things to say about working with him. You can apply with confidence! 

### What is David looking for in an applicant? Is David taking students this year?

You have to ask David these questions! He also has a [helpful page](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/students.html) on his website. :)

### What's it like living in Ithaca?

There are pros and cons. It's a beautiful college town that's very walkable and has great public transportation, cute cafes and restaurants, and lots of nearby hiking, waterfalls, and farms. However, the winters are long, dark, and cold, and Ithaca is 4.5 hours from NYC, 5 hours from Montreal, and 4.5 hours from Toronto; we're in the middle of nowhere. We have a small airport and buslines that go to NYC and other cities, but it can feel isolating. On the other hand, because Ithaca is so small, you'll see your friend and coworkers all the time. I often feel like I'm like living in a Friends episode, with people coming and going all the time! 

Full disclosure: Personally, I found the adjustment from a big city on the west coast very difficult. But I know many people who had a much easier time and love it here.

## Tips for Your Application

### Statement of Purpose

Your statement of purpose should answer these questions:
- Why do you want to do a PhD?
- What research topics are you interested in? Are you familiar with the current state of that field?
- What research (or similar work) have you done in the past? Which parts of those projects did you own? Did you come up with the ideas?
- Will you make it through a PhD program? Do you have perserverance, and can you work on your own?
- Why are you applying to Cornell? Which faculty are you interested in working with and why? (This can be just a few sentences total.)

Different people evaluate statements differently, but I also think your writing style is important. You want to convey excitement and originality, while being very specific about what you want to do, what you've done, and how you view your research area.

### CV

Your CV should be easy to read and should include your academic qualifications, your work experience, and your research experience and publications. You can also list class projects and unpublished work; just indicate clearly that they are unpublished or under review. 

### Letters of Reference

Since I'm not a professor, I don't have as much experience reading and writing these. However, my impression is that these letters are very important. If you're still a student or are planning to apply not this year but in the future, it would be smart to start thinking now about who your letter writers could be or where you could find letter writers. I think it's ok to ask people in industry (I had at least one industry letter), but they should be familar with your work and ideally have worked with you on research.

## I got in! Now what?

Congratulations! The main challenge left is to choose between programs. If you can visit the campus in person, especially during the official visit days with other students, I would highly recommend doing so, as it can influence your decision a lot.

### Visit Days

Visit days can be a lot of fun! This is your reward for all the hard work, and now the different universities are going to wine and dine you. (Also, enjoy it now because it won't happen again for a very, very long time.) 

Some tips for the visit days:
- Talk to everyone! Of course, talk to your potential advisor's students, but also talk to other students in the program, who might feel more comfortable telling you the truth about that advisor. Try to identify a nice/helpful/experienced student and ask all those honest questions that are the real deal breakers.
- BE NICE. Even if you don't choose this program, it's *very* likely that you'll meet these students and faculty again. Academia is a small place! Be polite and professional, and recognize that while yes, everyone is trying to convince you to come to their program, and yes, they're all very excited about you, they've all also done amazing things and earned their place here. Don't disparage other people's work, their affiliations, or their demographic groups.
- Keep a level head. It's so exciting to finally meet some of your research heroes in person, and then to hear them saying "I want to work with you" can feel unreal. Enjoy it, but also take a step back and consider your own needs first. Ultimately, for various reasons, everyone at the visit day, from faculty to staff to students, is trying to persuade you to join their program. Even the most introverted and seemingly awkward professor is actually very skilled at persuasion (that's how they published their papers, won their grants, got their students!). I got this advice from Jean Yang's [blog]() before my visits, and it was really helpful.
- If possible, go for a walk on your own. Explore campus and the area where you might live. Try to picture your life in this place and see how it feels.
- For Cornell and other places in the northern U.S., bring a warm coat and shoes!

### Choosing Between Programs

Ultimately, you have to follow your heart. You only get one PhD (hopefully), and it's a huge commitment of time, energy, and money. You don't want to have any regrets, so listen to your gut! When I was deciding between programs, I found this video about making [hard choices]() very helpful.

Here are some factors I would consider:
- Advisor. This is the most important. Who do you want to work with? Are they kind and supportive? 
- Back up advisor. Sometimes professors leave academia, retire, get sick, etc. They're human and these things happen more often than you might expect! Or you might not click with your original advisor. If there isn't anyone else to work with, you might face some hard decisions, so I recommend going somewhere with multiple interesting faculty.
- Location. Be honest with yourself about where you'll be healthiest and happiest. In addition, different countries have different timelines and systems, e.g., Europe has 3 year PhD programs while most US programs take at least 5 years.
- Money. Did one of the programs offer you a fellowship? What is the cost of living around the university? 
- Other students. You're going to be spending *a lot* of time with these people. Do you feel comfortable with them? Do you feel safe and represented?
