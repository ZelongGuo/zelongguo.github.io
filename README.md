1. google the following keyword:  
`site:https://zelongguo.github.io/`  
If the site is not indexed by google, then you need try **google search console** and do the following steps  
2. there are several ways to index your site, here we use the tracking ID on google analytics:  
   creat a tracking ID on google analytics and copy the 'global site tag (gtag.js)' to the default.html (the \<head> section), then you can check the reports snapshort real-time visits on google analytics
4. to help your site to be indexed and searched better, you can creat the sitemap.xml on [sitemap](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com), and then add it to your root directory
5. modify the settings on **google search console**, add your sitemap.xml and inspect your site URL, a moment may be needed for google to index your site
