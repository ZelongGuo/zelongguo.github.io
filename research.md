#### Co- and Post-seismic Modeling of 2017 Iran-Iraq (Sarpol -e Zahab) Mw 7.3 Earthquake  
1. This is the 1st work for my PhD **(Guo et al., 2020, *[published on JGR](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JB025148))***:  
Using coseismic and postseismic InSAR observations, we analyzed the fault geometry and afterslip evolution within 3 years after the mainshock.  

   For coseismic modeling, we attampt to investigate whether a listric fault could better explain the coseismic deformation than a planar fault from the perspective of coseismic data fitting, because it is usual to develope listric faults in the foreland of the mountain range. However, we found a simple planar fault could explain the observations well enough (Figure 1).
