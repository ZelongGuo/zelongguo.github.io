### About Me

I got my PhD degree in Geodesy/Geophysics at [GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/) and [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/), and worked with Prof. [Mahdi Motagh](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/mahdi-motagh/sec14/) in radar and optical remote sensing for analysis of geohazards group. My research interests span geodetic technique, geophysical inversions and the interpretation of geological tectonic deformation.
