### About 

I am a Ph.D candidate of Geodesy/Geophysics in [GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/home/) and [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/). Currently I work with Prof. [Mahdi Motagh](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/staff/mahdi-motagh/sec14/) in radar and optical remote sensing for analysis of geohazards group. My research interests span geodetic technique, geophysical inversions and the interpretation of geological tectonic deforamtion.  

For my Ph.D, my researches focus on the post- and inter-seismic deformation associated with the 2017 Mw 7.3 Iran-Iraq border (Sarpol-e Zahab) earthquake and the Zagros orogen, combined with geodetic inversion, numerical modeling and the analysis of geological tectonics growth in this region.
