<!-- ## Hello! -->

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg"> -->

<!-- I'm an [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) PhD student at Cornell University working in natural language processing. My advisor is [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

I have a master's degree in computational linguistics from the University of Washington, where I was advised by [Fei Xia](http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/), and I've worked at organizations like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/empowermd/), [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnl.gov/) (PNNL), and [Maana](https://www.maana.io/), a data analytics startup. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests

My research is in natural language processing and machine learning. I'm interested in unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques, such as word embeddings and topic modeling. I study how these techniques can be used to explore new datasets, ranging from social media to literature to medical data. I'm especially interested in questions about narrative and semantic similarity.

## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.png">

I am a researcher and data scientist working in natural language processing. I am interested in modeling how people express their subjective experiences through text, especially in the contexts of healthcare and the humanities, and often in the setting of online communities. I rely on unsupervised machine learning methods, and I re-explore the evaluation of these methods when applied to small, brittle datasets. 

My past work has explored how people communicate their [pain levels]() to physicians, how postpartum people frame their [birth experiences](), and how the use of word embedding models require additional [stability tests]() when used to measure biases.

I am currently a PhD candidate in [Information Science](http://infosci.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, where I'm advised by [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/). I have a master's degree in [Computational Linguistics](https://www.compling.uw.edu/) from the University of Washington and have worked as a data scientist and research intern at places like [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), [Facebook Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/core-data-science/), and [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnl.gov/).
